# Delivery System / F-Truck project with Gradle

## About this project

This repository stores a template project about `F-Truck`. You will use this project to get started and will add your developed software to this project. 

## Getting Started

To develop software you need following things: 
- Development tools installed as per instructions (IntelliJIDEA and Git/GitHub/SourceTree are must, Gradle is optional).
- Learn (reading provided documentation) about capabilities of motors and sensors and how you can control them with your Java code. See section: Documenatation of system for links to this documentation and to see different code examples. 

To run software you need following things: 
- Your truck (this is where your software will execute - not on your computer!) 
- One computer per team with all development tools installed (here Gradle is necessary as well). 

## How to run your code on truck (when you have access to truck in Lab)

The project includes latest dependencies and an example ready to be deployed on Forklift Truck using the `F-Truck` library from `CONNEX-AB-Delivery-System`. The project includes some tasks to reduce the time to deploy on your robot.

To start, change the `brickHost`, `brickUser` and `brickPassword` properties in `config.gradle`. Then, continue to the brick setup.

Steps to connect to Truck: 
1) Switch on Truck and wait for OS to load.
2) To start, check the `brickHost`, `brickUser` and `brickPassword` properties in `config.gradle`.
2) Especially, check the IP of Truck (by default for this truck it should be 192.168.122.94 - if not, update the file `config.gradle`):

```
// Brick connection parameters //
    brickHost = "192.168.122.94"
    brickUser = "robot"
    brickPassword = "maker"
```

3) Open Terminal or Command Line. Locate to Project file folder (use commands cd <project directory>). 
4) Connect your computer network to BTH (you don't need to login into this network, just connect). 
5) Now you can use the Java IDE to launch the task or execute them from the terminal

```
./gradlew deployRun
```

5b) Some other tasks associated to deploy on your robot are:

- `testConnection` - Test connection to the brick.
- `deploy` - Deploy a new build of the program to the brick.
- `deployRun` - Deploy a new build of the program to the brick and then run it.
- `run` - Run the program that is currently loaded on the brick.
- `undeploy` - Remove previously uploaded JAR.
- `pkillJava` - Kill running Java instances.
- `fatJar` - Build a fat JAR with all dependencies included inside.

# Documenatation of system

## General information

LEGO brick is running on Debian-based operating system ev3dev: https://github.com/ev3dev (for more info see ev3dev links).

And is programmed in JAVA: http://ev3dev-lang-java.github.io/#/. JAVA programms are deployed on brick by using Gradle,
to see how it is done, follow this link: http://ev3dev-lang-java.github.io/docs/support/getting_started/create-your-first-project.html.

## Examples

Exist several examples ready to use here:

https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/examples

Another Git repo for example source code available here: https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/template_project_gradle).

In order to modify examples, current full APIs are:

http://ev3dev-lang-java.github.io/docs/api/latest/index.html

You mostly will use EV3 Sensors in package: ev3dev.sensors.ev3 <br />
And classes: EV3ColorSensor, EV3IRSensor, EV3TouchSensor, EV3UltrasonicSensor <br />
*note: we also will use custom LineReaderV2 class, documentation here: TODO: LINK <br />


You mostly will use EV3 Motors in package: ev3dev.actuators.lego.motors <br />
And classes: EV3LargeRegulatedMotor, EV3MediumRegulatedMotor

## Sensors and Motors

For ev3dev OS capabilities on EV3Brick and BrickPI3, you can read here: http://docs.ev3dev.org/en/ev3dev-jessie/

You can learn about sensor capabilities here: http://docs.ev3dev.org/projects/lego-linux-drivers/en/ev3dev-jessie/sensor_data.html

You can learn about sensor capabilities here: http://docs.ev3dev.org/projects/lego-linux-drivers/en/ev3dev-jessie/motor_data.html

Hint: value0 -> value(0) in Java.

## Network

If necessary, to set-up wifi, you can access robot through ssh and then use "connman", described here (Section: Connecting to an open access point):  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ConnMan#Connecting_to_an_open_access_point


## Configuration

You can change the project configuration in `config.gradle`.
- `mainClass` - Main class of your program.
- `brickHost` - IP address of your brick.
- `brickUser` - Username on your brick.
- `brickPassword` - Password for the `brickUser`.
- `opencv` - Whether to include OpenCV libraries.
- `rxtx` - Whether to include RXTX library.
- `userClasspath` - List of additional URLs for runtime Java classpath.
- `useTime` - Can be used to measure the time for which the program runs.
- `useBrickman` - Should be used when running the program on a brick with a display.
- `useSudo` - If true, the program is launched under root.
- `jvmFlags` - Flags for Java Virtual Machine.
  - `-Xlog:class+load=info,class+unload=info ` - Display the debugging info for class loading.
  - `-Xshare:on ` - Enable Class Data Sharing (recommended).
  - `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=7091 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false ` - Enable JMX agent.
  - `-noverify ` - Do not verify class bytecode. This can be used to speed up startup time, but it is also a potential big security risk.
  - `-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 ` - Do not perform many optimizations. This can be used to speed up startup time.
  - `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom ` - This can be used to speed up random number generation.
- `slimJar` - Whether to generate a small JAR with external dependencies, or rather to generate a fat jar with embedded dependencies.
- `useEmbeddedPaths` - Whehter to use classpath and mainclass embedded in JAR or if they should be supplied on the command line.
